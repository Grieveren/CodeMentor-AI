# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The CodeMentor AI project has a fully functional backend with authentication, AI integration, code execution, and lesson management capabilities. However, the frontend is currently just a basic React shell. This feature will complete the frontend application to provide a comprehensive user interface that connects to all existing backend services and delivers the full CodeMentor AI experience.

3. WHEN a user views lesson details THEN the system SHALL show prerequisites, estimated time, and learning outcomes
4. WHEN a user starts a lesson THEN the system SHALL track progress and provide navigation between lesson steps

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a student, I want an integrated code editor so that I can write, test, and submit code solutions directly in the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens a coding exercise THEN the system SHALL provide a Monaco Editor with syntax highlighting for the target language
2. WHEN a user writes code THEN the system SHALL provide IntelliSense, error highlighting, and auto-completion
3. WHEN a user clicks "Run Code" THEN the system SHALL execute the code using the backend execution service and display results
4. WHEN code execution completes THEN the system SHALL show output, errors, and execution time in a dedicated panel
5. WHEN a user submits code THEN the system SHALL validate the solution and provide feedback

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a student, I want AI-powered code reviews so that I can receive detailed feedback on my coding solutions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests a code review THEN the system SHALL send the code to the AI service and display comprehensive feedback
2. WHEN the AI analysis completes THEN the system SHALL show suggestions for style, correctness, performance, and security
3. WHEN viewing code review results THEN the system SHALL highlight specific lines with inline comments and suggestions
4. WHEN a user receives feedback THEN the system SHALL provide actionable recommendations for improvement

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a student, I want to chat with an AI tutor so that I can get help and explanations for coding concepts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN a user sends a message THEN the system SHALL stream the AI response in real-time using WebSocket connections
3. WHEN discussing code THEN the system SHALL support code syntax highlighting in chat messages
4. WHEN the chat session is active THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation context and history

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a student, I want to track my learning progress so that I can see my improvement and identify areas for focus.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses their dashboard THEN the system SHALL display progress metrics, completed lessons, and achievements
2. WHEN viewing progress details THEN the system SHALL show charts and visualizations of learning statistics
3. WHEN a user completes activities THEN the system SHALL update progress indicators in real-time
4. WHEN reviewing performance THEN the system SHALL provide insights and recommendations for continued learning
