# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The CodeMentor AI project will be transformed into a comprehensive learning platform that teaches developers specification-based development methodology. This approach emphasizes creating detailed requirements, design documents, and implementation plans before writing code. The platform will guide learners through the complete specification-driven development workflow, from initial requirements gathering to final implementation, using interactive lessons, AI-powered feedback, and hands-on coding exercises.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer learning specification-based development, I want access to structured lessons that teach the methodology so that I can understand and apply spec-driven development practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the lessons section THEN the system SHALL display a curriculum covering requirements gathering, design documentation, and implementation planning
2. WHEN a user selects a specification methodology lesson THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step guidance on creating requirements documents using EARS format
3. WHEN a user progresses through lessons THEN the system SHALL teach design document creation, architecture planning, and task breakdown techniques
4. WHEN a user completes methodology lessons THEN the system SHALL provide practical exercises to apply specification-based development principles

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to create and manage specification documents within the platform so that I can practice the spec-driven development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts a new project THEN the system SHALL provide templates for requirements documents, design documents, and task lists
2. WHEN a user creates a requirements document THEN the system SHALL guide them through writing user stories and EARS-format acceptance criteria
3. WHEN a user develops a design document THEN the system SHALL provide structured sections for architecture, components, data models, and testing strategy
4. WHEN a user creates implementation tasks THEN the system SHALL help break down the design into actionable, testable development steps
5. WHEN a user completes a specification document THEN the system SHALL validate completeness and provide feedback on quality

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want AI-powered assistance in creating specification documents so that I can learn best practices and improve document quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user writes requirements THEN the system SHALL provide AI suggestions for improving clarity, completeness, and EARS format compliance
2. WHEN a user creates design documents THEN the system SHALL offer AI feedback on architecture decisions, component design, and missing considerations
3. WHEN a user breaks down tasks THEN the system SHALL suggest task refinements, dependencies, and implementation order optimization
4. WHEN a user requests document review THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive AI analysis with specific improvement recommendations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to implement code based on my specifications so that I can practice the complete spec-to-code workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes specification documents THEN the system SHALL provide a code editor linked to their task list
2. WHEN a user selects a task from their implementation plan THEN the system SHALL open the relevant code files and highlight the specific requirements to implement
3. WHEN a user writes code THEN the system SHALL validate implementation against the original requirements and design specifications
4. WHEN a user completes a task THEN the system SHALL check code quality, test coverage, and adherence to the specification
5. WHEN a user finishes implementation THEN the system SHALL provide feedback on how well the code matches the original specifications

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to track my progress through the specification-based development workflow so that I can see my improvement and identify areas for focus.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes specification documents THEN the system SHALL track progress through requirements, design, and implementation phases
2. WHEN a user works on projects THEN the system SHALL measure specification quality, implementation accuracy, and adherence to methodology
3. WHEN viewing progress THEN the system SHALL display metrics on specification completeness, design thoroughness, and code-to-spec alignment
4. WHEN a user reviews their learning journey THEN the system SHALL provide insights on specification-based development skill improvement over time

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a learner, I want interactive exercises that simulate real-world specification-based development scenarios so that I can practice the methodology in realistic contexts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses practice exercises THEN the system SHALL provide realistic project scenarios requiring complete specification workflows
2. WHEN a user works through exercises THEN the system SHALL simulate stakeholder feedback, changing requirements, and design challenges
3. WHEN a user makes specification decisions THEN the system SHALL show the downstream impact on design and implementation
4. WHEN a user completes exercises THEN the system SHALL provide detailed feedback on their specification-based development approach and outcomes

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to collaborate with others on specification documents so that I can learn collaborative spec-driven development practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a specification project THEN the system SHALL support multi-user collaboration with real-time editing and commenting
2. WHEN team members review specifications THEN the system SHALL provide structured review workflows with approval processes
3. WHEN collaborating on documents THEN the system SHALL track changes, maintain version history, and resolve conflicts
4. WHEN working in teams THEN the system SHALL facilitate role-based access to different specification phases and provide communication tools

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a learner, I want access to a comprehensive library of specification examples and templates so that I can learn from best practices and accelerate my learning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user explores the template library THEN the system SHALL provide specification examples from various domains and project types
2. WHEN a user selects a template THEN the system SHALL show annotated examples explaining best practices and common patterns
3. WHEN a user creates new specifications THEN the system SHALL suggest relevant templates and provide customization guidance
4. WHEN a user studies examples THEN the system SHALL highlight key specification techniques, common pitfalls, and quality indicators

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to understand the business impact of specification-based development so that I can advocate for and implement this methodology in my organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes the learning program THEN the system SHALL provide case studies showing the business benefits of specification-based development
2. WHEN a user explores methodology benefits THEN the system SHALL present data on reduced development time, fewer bugs, and improved team collaboration
3. WHEN a user learns about implementation THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on introducing spec-driven development to existing teams and projects
4. WHEN a user seeks organizational support THEN the system SHALL offer templates for proposals, training plans, and success metrics for specification-based development adoption
